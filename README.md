BEM naming convention - easy way of naming components in React

place-items: center;

/* Use up full width, takes up all the room */ flex: 1;

/* Center the items in the container */ align-items: center;

// If something is overflowing overflow: scroll;

.chat__headerRight { display: flex; justify-content: space-between; min-width: 100px; }

/* Depending on how much text is in there, it will just reach that amount*/ width: fit-content;

position: relative;

// move to the top position: absolute;

.chat__footer > form > button { /* Get rid of the button but the functionality still holds */ display: none; }

{/* DataLayer that surrounds the app. I can push information into the data layer and i can pull it from any component*/}
